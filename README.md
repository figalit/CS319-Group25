FrogSim is an arcade game developed during 1981. The concept involves a moving car that is constantly trying to avoid obstacles to level up. We have considered doing something similiar for this course, adding some twists to it as well with the aim of making the game more interesting. Positive power ups such as slower traffic or flying will male your game easier while negative power ups like random traffic direction and slowness will devastate you. Since our game will have different sized cars and projectiles etc. it will be heavily dependant on objects.
